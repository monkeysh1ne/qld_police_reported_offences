# qld_police_reported_offences
### A Shiny web app displaying Queensland Police Reported Offenses from 2001 - 2023

Using publicly available data from [QLD Police](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/maps-and-statistics)
this app allows users to view data on reported offenses and filter these by Year, Police Regional Division and/or Offence Category.

The CSV data file is included in this repo.

To use this app you will need to install the R language and the packages as listed in app.R
To view, edit or amend the script I recommend using [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (free, Open Source)

Everything in this repo is free and open source.
Enjoy!
